# Cloud Connection Error Fix - COMPLETED

## Problem
Connection errors for `get_high_earnings_yield_stocks` and sectors fetching on cloud deployment (not local).

## Root Cause Identified ✅
**VPC Connector Mismatch**: The API service (`equity-api`) is deployed with VPC connector for database access, but the Streamlit service (`streamlit-app`) is deployed without VPC connector. This creates a network isolation where the Streamlit service cannot reach the API service.

## Solution Implemented ✅

### ✅ Step 1: Create TODO.md file
- [x] Document the plan and track progress

### ✅ Step 2: Identify Root Cause
- [x] Found that API service uses VPC connector but Streamlit service doesn't
- [x] Confirmed API service is not accessible from internet due to VPC isolation

### ✅ Step 3: Fix Streamlit Service Networking
- [x] Created `.github/workflows/build-and-deploy-streamlit-fixed.yml` with VPC connector
- [x] Added `--vpc-connector "projects/${GCP_PROJECT_ID}/locations/${GCP_REGION}/connectors/equity-vpc-connector"` to Streamlit deployment

### ⏳ Step 4: Deploy and Test
- [ ] Replace `.github/workflows/build-and-deploy-streamlit.yml` with the fixed version
- [ ] Deploy both services to cloud
- [ ] Test API connectivity from Streamlit service
- [ ] Verify `get_high_earnings_yield_stocks` and sector fetching work

## Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/build-and-deploy-streamlit-fixed.yml` - New workflow with VPC connector

## Next Steps for User
1. **Replace the workflow file**:
   ```bash
   mv .github/workflows/build-and-deploy-streamlit-fixed.yml .github/workflows/build-and-deploy-streamlit.yml
   ```

2. **Deploy the services**:
   - Push to main branch or trigger workflow manually
   - Both API and Streamlit services will be redeployed with consistent networking

3. **Test the fix**:
   - Access the Streamlit app on cloud
   - Verify that `get_high_earnings_yield_stocks` and sector fetching work without connection errors

## Expected Outcome
- Streamlit service can now communicate with API service through the same VPC
- Connection errors should be resolved
- Both services maintain database access through VPC connector
