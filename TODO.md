# TODO: Fix Google API IPv6 Connectivity Issue - COMPLETED ✅

## Summary
Successfully resolved the google.api_core.exceptions.RetryError with IPv6 "Network is unreachable" by forcing IPv4 connections for Google Cloud services.

## Changes Made
- [x] Added IPv4 forcing configuration in `data_pipeline/config.py`
- [x] Set `GRPC_DNS_RESOLVER=ares` to use IPv4 DNS resolution
- [x] Set `GOOGLE_CLOUD_DISABLE_GRPC_IPV6=true` to disable IPv6 for Google Cloud libraries

## Test Results
- [x] Database connection (Cloud SQL): ✅ SUCCESS
- [x] Cloud Storage access: ✅ SUCCESS
- [x] Config loading: ✅ SUCCESS
- [x] Gmail utils import: ✅ SUCCESS
- [x] Macro data loader: ✅ SUCCESS

## Notes
- Configuration is applied automatically when `data_pipeline.config` is imported
- This resolves the "connect: Network is unreachable (101)" error for IPv6 addresses like `2a00:1450:4009:c15::5f`
- No deployment configuration changes needed as the fix is applied at runtime
