# Cross-Check and Deployment Updates

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Reviewed VPC changes in cloudrun-service.yaml
- [x] Updated build-and-deploy.yml workflow to include --vpc-connector
- [x] Updated deploy-cloud-run.sh script to include --vpc-connector
- [x] Updated build-and-deploy-streamlit.yml workflow to include --vpc-connector
- [x] Updated cloudrun-service.yaml to use variables for connector name

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test deployment with VPC connector
- [ ] Verify VPC connector exists in GCP project
- [ ] Ensure database connectivity works with VPC access
- [ ] Update README.md if needed with VPC deployment notes

## Notes
- VPC connector name: projects/${GCP_PROJECT_ID}/locations/${GCP_REGION}/connectors/equity-vpc-connector
- All deployment methods (CLI and YAML) now include VPC access
- Streamlit app also updated for VPC access since it connects to database
